                        <h1 class="text-light-green mb-4">Who is Peter Mbah?</h1>
                        <div class="text-white mb-4">Peter Mbah hails from owo in Nkanu East Local Government of Enugu state. He is a very successful businessman who has built so many successful companies. He obtained his law degree from East London and also an accomplished financial analyst. As a lawyer he will take more than a cursory look at everything he does and compliment it with financial prudence.</div>
                        <div class="text-white mb-4">He was a state commissioner for finance and economic development under His Excellency Dr Chimaroke Nnamani.</div>
                        <div class="text-white"> As the finance commissioner he was a member of the Federal Accounts Allocation committee(FAAC), Chairman Federal Accounts Allocation Committee’s sub committee on Legal Matters, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Enugu State Finance and Investment Company and Enugu State Insurance Company. Because of his sterling performance while serving the state as commissioner for Finance and Economic development, he was described as *“a man ahead of his time”* by a special publication in Newswatch magazine on 3rd July,2006.</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <div class="text-white mb-4">He also served as the Chief of Staff to the Governor in 2003 and by virtue of this position was member of the State Executive council, Member of the State Security council and Chairman of the Enugu State Tenders’ Board. Peter Mbah is a successful businessman. One of his firms-Pinnacle oil and gas Ltd -is a key player in the Nigerian oil and gas downstream sector.</div>

                        <div class="text-white mb-4">A combination of his experience in the public and private sector is a big plus and it marks him out as a technocrat who will leverage on these attributes and wealth of experiences to make a world of difference- a positive difference- in the governance of Enugu State.</div>

                        <div class="text-white mb-4">Having served as a commissioner and a chief of staff, he is very conversant with the yearnings of the good people of Enugu state. This knowledge combined with his  sterling personal qualities will certainly propel him to chart a course which will endear him to the hearts of the people.</div>
                        <div class="text-white mb-4">It is noteworthy that Peter Mbah is already a wealthy and successful man, a billionaire. He is not necessarily coming to make money out of governance but to contribute his own quota to the growth of the state, and to leave a legacy of service to the people. If he is fully supported, he will achieve the goal of bequeathing us with a new and prosperous Enugu.</div>


                        <div class="text-white">Building the Enugu of our dream is no easy undertaking, and this platform was created in the strong belief that Peter Mbah is the ideal man for the job. We will use this opportunity and every resource at our disposal to promote his sterling characteristics and spread them throughout Enugu State, showing the good people of Enugu why they should not only cast their votes for but believe strongly in Peter Mbah in the 2023 gubernatorial election.</div>
